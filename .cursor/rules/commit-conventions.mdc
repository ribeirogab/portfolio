# Commit Conventions

## Overview

This document outlines the commit message conventions and git workflow used in the W3Midias monorepo. Consistent commit messages improve project history readability, facilitate automated changelog generation, and help track changes across the monorepo's applications and packages.

## Principles

- **Clarity**: Commit messages should clearly describe what changes were made
- **Consistency**: Follow a standard format for all commit messages
- **Traceability**: Make it easy to trace changes back to requirements or issues
- **Atomicity**: Each commit should represent a single logical change

## Applicability

- **When to apply**: When making any commits to the repository
- **When not to apply**: When working in personal branches before squashing into a feature branch

## Recommended Structure

The project follows the Conventional Commits specification with the following format:

```plaintext
<type>: <description>
```

```plaintext
# ✅ Examples of good commit messages

feat: add contact form to homepage
fix: resolve button hover state in dark mode
docs: update installation instructions
chore: update dependency versions
refactor: simplify authentication logic
test: add unit tests for validator

# ❌ Examples of poor commit messages

update stuff
fixed bug
WIP
checkpoint
```

## Best Practices

- ✅ Use the following types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, `build`
- ✅ Write descriptive messages in imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature")
- ✅ Keep the first line under 72 characters
- ❌ Don't use vague commit messages
- ❌ Avoid very large commits with multiple unrelated changes
- ❌ Don't include temporary or debugging code in commits

## Common Pitfalls

- Writing vague commit messages that don't clearly describe the changes
- Including unrelated changes in a single commit
- Forgetting to include the scope in monorepo projects
- Not following the conventional commits format
- Making large commits that are difficult to review and understand

## Additional Notes

- These conventions are based on the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification
- Proper commit messages help with automated versioning and changelog generation
